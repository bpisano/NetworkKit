import Foundation

/// A protocol that defines the interface for HTTP clients in NetworkKit.
///
/// `HttpClient` provides the core functionality for making HTTP requests and processing
/// responses. It defines the configuration properties and methods needed for network
/// communication.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let client: HttpClient = Client("https://api.example.com")
/// let response = try await client.perform(GetUserRequest(id: "123"))
/// ```
///
/// ## Configuration Properties
///
/// - `baseUrl`: The base URL for all requests
/// - `encoder`: JSON encoder for request bodies
/// - `decoder`: JSON decoder for response bodies
/// - `logger`: Logger for request/response logging
/// - `middlewares`: Array of request middleware
/// - `interceptors`: Array of response interceptors
public protocol HttpClient {
    /// The base URL for all requests made by this client.
    var baseUrl: URL { get }

    /// The JSON encoder used for encoding request bodies.
    var encoder: JSONEncoder { get set }

    /// The JSON decoder used for decoding response bodies.
    var decoder: JSONDecoder { get set }

    /// The logger used for logging request and response information.
    var logger: ClientLogger? { get set }

    /// An array of middleware that can modify requests before they are sent.
    var middlewares: [Middleware] { get set }

    /// An array of interceptors that can modify responses after they are received.
    var interceptors: [Interceptor] { get set }
}

extension HttpClient {
    /// Default JSON encoder implementation.
    ///
    /// Returns a new `JSONEncoder` instance with default configuration.
    public var encoder: JSONEncoder { .init() }

    /// Default JSON decoder implementation.
    ///
    /// Returns a new `JSONDecoder` instance with default configuration.
    public var decoder: JSONDecoder { .init() }

    /// Default logger implementation.
    ///
    /// Returns the default client logger that provides comprehensive logging.
    public var logger: ClientLogger? { .default }

    /// Default middleware array implementation.
    ///
    /// Returns an empty array, meaning no middleware will be applied by default.
    public var middlewares: [Middleware] { [] }

    /// Default interceptor array implementation.
    ///
    /// Returns an empty array, meaning no interceptors will be applied by default.
    public var interceptors: [Interceptor] { [] }

    /// Performs an HTTP request and decodes the response to the specified type.
    ///
    /// This method sends the request, processes any middleware and interceptors,
    /// and automatically decodes the response body to the specified `ServerResponse` type.
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct User: Codable {
    ///     let id: String
    ///     let name: String
    /// }
    ///
    /// let response = try await client.perform(GetUserRequest(id: "123"))
    /// let user = response.data  // User type
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - request: The HTTP request to perform
    ///   - onProgress: Optional closure called with progress updates during the request
    /// - Returns: A `Response<ServerResponse>` containing the decoded data and response metadata
    /// - Throws: An error if the request fails or the response cannot be decoded

    ///
    /// This method is useful for requests where you only care about the response status
    /// and headers, not the body content (e.g., DELETE requests).
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// try await client.perform(DeleteUserRequest(id: "123"))
    /// ```

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - request: The HTTP request to perform

    ///
    /// This method is useful when you need to handle the response data manually
    /// or when the response format is not known at compile time.
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let response = try await client.performRaw(GetDataRequest())
    /// let data = response.data  // Raw Data
    /// ```

    ///
    /// This method orchestrates the request lifecycle:
    /// 1. Builds the URLRequest from the HttpRequest
    /// 2. Applies middleware modifications
    /// 3. Logs the outgoing request
    /// 4. Performs the actual network request
    /// 5. Applies interceptor modifications
    /// 6. Logs the response
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - request: The HTTP request to perform
    ///   - onProgress: Optional closure called with progress updates during the request
    /// - Returns: A tuple containing the response data and URLResponse
    /// - Throws: An error if any step in the request lifecycle fails
